# X-CNN Lasagne

* Implementaion of X-CNN (Cross Modal Convolutional Neural Networks) paper in [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).

* The aim of this repo is not to reproduce the results of the paper but to help/act as a reference for people who want to implement the concept presented in the paper, in their own neural networks easily.
